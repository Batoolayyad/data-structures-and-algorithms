# Singly Linked List


A data structure that contains nodes each node(the individual links inside a linked list and it contains the data for the link) references the next Node in the list (by the proparity next). there are 2 typs: Singly and Doubly,



## Challenge
Linked List Implementation:
creat **Singly Linked List** that:
1- insert: Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
2- includes: Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
3- to string: Returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"



## Approach & Efficiency

#### Approach

1- read the instruction carefully.
2- trying have clear understanding for the concept before starting.
3- start writing the code after having clear vision of what I should do.
4- go throw each test and try different cases to make sure it will pass.  

#### Efficiency

Big O:
- time:  o(n)
- space: o(n)


## API


1- insert: Adds a new node with a value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
2- includes: Indicates whether a value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
3- to string: Returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
