# Trees



## Code challenge(15): 
### Implementation Trees


#### Create a Binary Tree class
##### Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
- pre order, in order, post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
- the code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

### Binary Search Tree
#### Create a Binary Search Tree class
##### This class should be a sub-class of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
- **Add** 
- **Arguments: value**
- **Return: nothing**

#### The Add method should add a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

#### Adding  a search method that indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
